From the graph, there are more countries with a lower Life Expectancy in 1953 compared to 2008.
In 1953 there are 50 countries in the high and 86 in the low life expectancy clusters.
In 2008 there are 120 countries in the high and 34 in the low life expectancy cluster.
The movement from low to high life expectancy is associated with a lower birth rate for those countries
when you compare 1953 to 2008.
Countries with lower birthrates clearly have higher life expectancy.

For each cluster, the mean birthrate decreases from 1953 to 2008. With this decrease in birthrate
there is an increase in life expectancy per cluster.

From the graph it is clear that a lower Birth Rate is associated with a higher Life Expectancy.

Cluster 1 has a mean birth rate of 13 and mean life expectancy of 76 and includes 97 countries. This 
cluster is mostly made up of 2008 countries, with 4 1953 countries including Channel Islands, Norway,
Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Cluster 4 has a mean birth rate of 47 and mean life expectancy of 40 and includes 97 countries. This
cluster is mostly made up of 1953 countries, with 5 2008 countries including Afghanistan, Chad, Congo
and Niger.

The above two observations could be due to the average number of countries that had higher life expectancy
and lower birth rates from 1953 to 2008. Cluster 4 mostly has 1953 countries because in 1953 there were
more countries on average with lower life expectancy and higher birthrates. But as countries developed and
became more educated, birthrates lowered and life expectancy increased. Therefore, in 2008, we see Cluster 1
in mostly made up of 2008 countries as life expectancy has increased on average.

Countries like South Africa has moved from Cluster 4 (lowest life expectancy cluster of 47 year) to 
Cluster 2 (life expectancy of 67 years) and has therefore moved up as birth rates decrease and life expectancy 
increases.

South Africa 2008 and United States 1953 are in the same Cluster 2. Therefore, both countries at different
times are sharing a cluster with birthrate of 23 and Life Expectancy of 67. In 55 year, South Africa
has moved from the lowest cluster to where the United States was in 1953. The United States has in the same
time period moved up one cluster to the cluster with the highest Life Expectancy of 76.

It is clear that as the world has developed and birth rates have decreased, life expectancy has increased.
